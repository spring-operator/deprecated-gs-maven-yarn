This guide walks you through using Maven to build a simple Spring YARN project.

== What you'll build

You'll create a simple app and then build it using Maven.

NOTE: In this guide we are not trying to create fully working YARN application, instead we focus on project and build model.

== What you'll need

 - About 15 minutes
 - A favorite text editor or IDE
 - {jdk}[JDK 6] or later

If you're not familiar with gradle, refer to
link:/guides/gs/maven[Building Java Projects with Maven].

== Set up the project

First you set up a Java project for Gradle to build. To keep the focus on Gradle, make the project as simple as possible for now.

include::https://raw.github.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/create_directory_structure_yarn_hello.adoc[]

Here you create a `ContainerApplication` class.

`container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java[]
----

Here you create an `AppmasterApplication` class.

`appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java[]
----

Here you create a `ClientApplication` class.

`client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java[]
----

Here you create a `application` yaml configuration file for all
sub-projects.

`container/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/container/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

`appmaster/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/appmaster/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

`client/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/client/src/main/resources/application.yml[]

== Understanding Maven Usage with Spring YARN

Here you create a main parent `pom.xml` file.

`pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/pom.xml[]
----

We created a project structure placing `appmaster`, `container` and
`client` in its own sub-projects. Additionally we added a fourth
project named `dist` which only purpose is to use `assembly` plugin
to collect all artifacts together when project is build.

Here you create an appmaster `pom.xml` file.

`appmaster/pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/appmaster/pom.xml[]
----

Here you create a container `pom.xml` file.

`container/pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/container/pom.xml[]
----

Here you create a client `pom.xml` file.

`client/pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/client/pom.xml[]
----

Here you create a distribution `pom.xml` file.

`dist/pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/dist/pom.xml[]
----

Here you create an assembly `assembly.xml` file.

`dist/assembly.xml`
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/dist/assembly.xml[]
----

== Declare dependencies

Spring for Apache Hadoop provides a transitive dependencies via its
own maven poms against different Hadoop distribution. This way you
don't need to worry about which dependencies are actually needed if
you are building against vanilla Hadoop, Hortonworks Data Platform or
Cloudera Distribution for Hadoop. 

[source,xml]
.Vanilla Hadoop 2.2.X
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-yarn-boot</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0.RC1</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[source,xml]
.Hortonworks Data Platform 2.X
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-yarn-boot</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0.RC1-hdp20</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[source,xml]
.Cloudera Distrobution including Hadoop 5.X
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-yarn-boot</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0.RC1-cdh5</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

== Build Application Packages

Run build.

[source,text]
----
./mvn clean package
----

You should see three jar files created.

[source,text]
----
dist/target/gs-maven-yarn-dist-0.1.0-dist/
dist/target/gs-maven-yarn-dist-0.1.0-dist/gs-maven-yarn-container-0.1.0.jar
dist/target/gs-maven-yarn-dist-0.1.0-dist/gs-maven-yarn-appmaster-0.1.0.jar
dist/target/gs-maven-yarn-dist-0.1.0-dist/gs-maven-yarn-client-0.1.0.jar
----

== Summary

Congratulations! You have now created a simple yet effective Maven build file for building Spring YARN projects.
